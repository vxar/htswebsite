  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    Hamilton Tamil Sangam (HTS) was established in 2020 to foster unity and cultural integration among Tamil-speaking 
    families in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Over the past 5 years, we've expanded from a small group of families to 
    a vibrant community of over 100 families. We organize annual events that celebrate our rich Tamil heritage, 
    promote cultural exchange, and strengthen community bonds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to create a supportive environment where Tamil culture thrives, and families can connect, share, 
    and grow together in Canada.
